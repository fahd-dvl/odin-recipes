    <h2>A burger is a popular and versatile food item consisting of a cooked patty, typically made from ground beef, placed between two halves of a bun. It can be customized with a variety of toppings such as lettuce, tomato, cheese, pickles, onions, and sauces. While the classic version features a beef patty, there are many variations that include chicken, fish, vegetarian, and plant-based patties. Known for its satisfying combination of textures and flavors, the burger has become a staple in fast food and casual dining around the world.
