    <h2>Pizza is a popular and versatile dish originating from Italy, consisting of a flat, round base of dough topped with a variety of ingredients. Traditionally, it includes tomato sauce, cheese (commonly mozzarella), and optional toppings like meats, vegetables, and herbs.

        It is baked in an oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Pizza is known for its endless customization possibilities, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences. Variations include classic Margherita, pepperoni, vegetarian, and gourmet styles. It's enjoyed worldwide as both a casual meal and a culinary art.
